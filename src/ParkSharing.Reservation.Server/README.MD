## Overview

This microservice is an essential part of the ParkSharing ecosystem. It comes with everything you need to help users reserve parking spots and manage their availability, all wrapped in a sleek UI. The star of the show here is our "CustomChat" componentâ€”because who doesn't want a chatbot with gradients?

## Setup

So you want to set this up locally? Brave soul. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need to do:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/ParkSharing-Reservation-Client.git
    cd ParkSharing-Reservation-Client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   The app will be running on `http://localhost:4001`. Feel free to poke around, but donâ€™t say we didnâ€™t warn you about the gradients.

## Usage

Once youâ€™ve got it running, youâ€™ll be greeted by a rather enthusiastic chat widget that can handle parking spot reservations like a pro. The app also features an **OwnerPage** where parking spot owners can manage their spots and availability.

## File Structure

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the chaos:

- **`src/`**: Where the magic happens.
  - **`App.js`**: Main entry point for our app. If this doesnâ€™t work, nothing will.
  - **`CustomChat.js`**: The shining star of this project. This chat widget will interact with users in a way you never thought possible.
  - **`OwnerPage.js`**: Allows parking spot owners to manage their empire of asphalt.
  - **`index.js`**: Renders the app into the DOM. Spoiler: itâ€™s important.
  - **`index.css`**: Global styles, because we need everything to look just right.
  
- **`public/`**: Publicly accessible files.
  - **`index.html`**: The shell of the app. Try not to mess with it too much.
  
- **`webpack.config.js`**: The configuration that makes all of this possible. If something breaks, start here.

## Contributing

Happy coding! ðŸŒˆðŸš—
