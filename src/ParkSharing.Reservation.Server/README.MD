# ParkSharing Reservation Client

Welcome to the **ParkSharing Reservation Client**! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains the front-end microservice responsible for managing parking spot reservations in the ParkSharing ecosystem. If you're here to inspect the code, make sure you buckle upâ€”this is the first React app by the owner, who proudly admits to being a *horrible* front-end developer. Thankfully, most of the code was generated by ChatGPT, so it might actually work.

## Overview

The **ParkSharing Reservation Client** is a React-based front-end application. It's meant to be part of a larger microservices setup but can be run independently if you're into debugging endless `CORS` errors. This project is full of CSS magic (or overuse, depending on your perspective) and a custom chat widget that stores everything in cookiesâ€”because why not?

### Disclaimer: 

Most of this code was generated by ChatGPT because the owner has a self-proclaimed terrible sense of UI/UX and this is their first React project. So, if you find anything that works particularly well, it's probably AI-powered. If it doesn't, well, now you know why.

## Features

- **Custom Chat Interface**: Fully featured chat widget that handles parking reservations. It even remembers your conversations using cookies. Pretty fancy, right?
- **Owner Page**: A page dedicated to managing parking spotsâ€”add, edit, and remove spots with a UI that only occasionally breaks.
- **Over-the-Top CSS**: Gradients, animations, and more! We have so many CSS variables, youâ€™ll wonder if this is a parking app or a design experiment.

## Setup

So you're feeling brave and want to run this locally? Here's how:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/ParkSharing-Reservation-Client.git
   cd ParkSharing-Reservation-Client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be running on `http://localhost:4001`. Tweak it at your own risk.

## Usage

Once it's running, you'll find:

- **Home Page**: Displays a chat widget that handles parking reservations. The chat remembers everything using cookiesâ€”just in case you wanted another reminder of what you typed 5 minutes ago.
- **Owner Page**: A place for owners to manage their parking spots. Add availability, adjust prices, and generally feel like a big deal.

### Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL`: This should point to your backend service. Without it, the chat widget is just a pretty box on your screen.

## File Structure

Hereâ€™s a quick look at the messâ€”I mean, structure:

- **`src/`**: Contains the React components and other code.
  - **`App.js`**: The main entry point for the app. This is where the magic (or chaos) begins.
  - **`CustomChat.js`**: The chat widget component. Expect a lot of cookie-based shenanigans.
  - **`OwnerPage.js`**: The page for parking spot owners. Manages CRUD operations with styleâ€”or at least with CSS.
  - **`index.js`**: Renders the entire application. Without this, nothing works, but you probably guessed that.
  - **`index.css`**: Global styles. Because everything needs to look somewhat cohesive.

- **`public/`**: Static files.
  - **`index.html`**: The shell of the app. Try not to touch it unless you know what youâ€™re doing (and even then, proceed with caution).

- **`webpack.config.js`**: Webpack configuration. This is what makes the app build and run. If something breaks, you might find the answer hereâ€”or at least more questions.
