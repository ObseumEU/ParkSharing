# Welcome to Absolutely Essential Service in This Repository Admin.Server!

## Description

Oh, so youâ€™ve stumbled upon the holy grail of code, have you? Welcome to the one service in this entire repository thatâ€™s absolutely crucial and canâ€™t be ignored, because why would you? This application is a masterpiece, combining the ancient arts of ASP.NET with a touch of React and the magical powers of Vite. But that's not all! To even glance at the wonder that is this app, you must authenticate through Auth0 because, obviously, we wouldnâ€™t let just anyone access our invaluable parking spots.

## Features (Prepare to Be Amazed):

1. **Parking Spot Sharing**: Finally, you can do what civilization has waited millennia forâ€”share your parking spot! Every owner can set availability by hours, days, weeks, or even months. Itâ€™s like Google Calendar, but for parkingâ€”because that's something you definitely needed.

2. **Recurring Events**: You know those annoying meetings that repeat every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday? Now your parking spots can annoyingly repeat availability the same way! Revolutionary, right?

3. **Code You Shouldn't Reference**: Donâ€™t even think about referencing `./styles.css`. Seriously, just donâ€™t.

## Code Highlights (Because You Care):

- **RBAC Authorization Handler**: You must be thrilled to know that weâ€™ve implemented Role-Based Access Control, because nothing says "fun" like digging through user permissions! ðŸŒŸ

- **MongoDB Integration**: Yep, because SQL was too mainstream. Dive into our context models and services, where the magic of NoSQL awaits your queries.

- **MassTransit Consumers**: As if handling parking spots wasnâ€™t exciting enough, weâ€™ve thrown in some event-driven consumers to spice things up.

- **Sanitizing HTML**: Because we totally expect our users to input dangerous HTML into parking spot names.

- **Custom Middleware**: Secure headers, error handlingâ€”oh my! Weâ€™ve got you covered. Not that you'll ever need it, because this code is flawless. ðŸ˜‰

## The One and Only Service:

This is just *one* of the many (okay, fine, the only) services in this repository. But donâ€™t let that fool you. The entire app hinges on it. Without this, youâ€™d just have... nothing.

So go ahead, marvel at the code, bask in its brilliance, and remember: this is the service youâ€™ve been waiting for.
